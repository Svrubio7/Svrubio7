### 🤖 Machine Learning | ⚽ Football addict | 🌊 Sea & watersports | 🚀 Always learning

## 🧠 About Me

I’m genuinely passionate about building solutions using ML and AI.

I spend my time building mostly B2B MicroSaaS for myself (hoping one blows up) and for other companies.

Love meeting builders (both technical and non-technical) and discussing ideas. 

I always have the user in mind. Friction must be minimal and the demand, real.

Glad to meet you and let's connect!
